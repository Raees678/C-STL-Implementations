# C++ Sample Implementation
I started this project as a way to practice my C++ skills and become familiar with data structures. It contains the STL data structures in mostly the same headers and folders. In the process I use several C++ features like templates, SFINAE, partial specializations etc. to implement the custom data structures with identical interface as the STL.
